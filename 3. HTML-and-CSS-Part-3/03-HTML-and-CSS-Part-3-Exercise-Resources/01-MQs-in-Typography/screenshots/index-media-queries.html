    <h1>Heading 1 H1 </h1>
    <img src="./screenshot-desktop.png" alt="picture1" class="first-img"/>
    <p>In the heart of Sofia, where the sun paints the sky with hues of gold and crimson, there lies a quaint little café. It's a place where time seems to slow down, where the aroma of freshly brewed coffee mingles with the scent of old books. The walls, adorned with vintage photographs and paintings, whisper tales of yesteryears. The soft hum of conversation, the clinking of cups, the rustling of pages turning - it's a symphony of everyday life. Here, in this café, people find a moment of respite from the hustle and bustle of the city, a haven where they can savor the simple joys of life.
